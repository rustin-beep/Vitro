/* JIT trace regression case #2 (2026-09-13) -- FIXED, kept green.
 *
 * Purpose: pin the ATTRIBUTION. The original field report blamed "writing a
 * `long long` local inside the loop body". That attribution was WRONG -- the
 * pure-int case (jit_nested_counting_loop.c) failed identically. This case
 * keeps the "long long is not the trigger" fact anchored in the corpus.
 *
 * Expected  (clang + `vitro_cli unified`): outer=200 inner=40000 sum=40000 i=200 j=200
 * Bug (before fix, `vitro_cli run` executor + JIT): outer=200 inner=20200 sum=20200 i=200 j=0
 *
 * Trigger conditions (all three were required):
 *   1. outer-loop back-edge count reaches JIT_THRESHOLD(100);
 *   2. the inner loop has already been JIT-compiled;
 *   3. the outer loop body contains no conditional branch (otherwise recording
 *      Aborts and the interpreter produces correct results).
 *
 * Discipline: this case must STAY GREEN (red->green trail: shadow before fix
 * = output_gap, after fix = match). Analysis:
 * docs/current/07-质量与裁定/核心资产重构裁定.md section 14.
